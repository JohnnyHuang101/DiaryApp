Johnny's first ever Diary app/notes taking app created using .NET and C sharp.

here is an example ASP.NET application created by johnny the baguette using C# and the .NET MVC framework. The front end is built only with HTML with no need for Javascript event listeners and instead utilizies "Controllers" from .NET framework. Tied together with a "service" backend for logic of creating new notes, deleting notes. Tied together also with main "controllers" framework as mentioned before that sets up the ROUTES for the application and website Index.cshtml page, my website link, privacy endpoint, etc. 

This note app is pretty cool since it utilizes a custom NoSQL database store using documents in JSON and the application REMEMBERS your notes forever even if you close the website and reopen it or even if you rebuild the entire website after changing some of the code like the styles of the CSS webpage. Try it out :). 

Instructions:

1) First download or clone my project
2) locate the JohnnnyDiaryWeb.sln solutions explorerer and open it in Visual Studio Code
3) Btw u might have to change the permissions of the files by going to the folder properties section and selecting "trust download from app" cause windows flags it as potentially unsafe
4) Build and run the release in VS code and thats it!
5) If you close the website, you can either rebuild the website or go into ur binaries folder created when you built and run the executable. Either way, your notes put before will be SAVED permanently!
6) star or giv some feedback if youd like i appreciate your support yey.
